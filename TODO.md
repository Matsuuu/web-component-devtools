# Web Component Devtools v2 TODO list


- [x] Highlight hovered element in DOM.
- [ ] Allow selecting an element in devtools and parsing basic data out of it 
- [ ] Set up CEM evaluation from local or generated manifest
- [ ] Allow updating attributes and properties through devtools
- [ ] Observe events from devtools
- [ ] Recognize between Lit etc. elements
- [ ] Inspect element via Context Menu
- [ ] If acquiring data from browser alone is too tricky, we could make a Vite plugin?
