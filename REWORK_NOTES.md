# UI Rework notes for when I can't code

- Update the UI to use Shoelace components and make the whole UI more bearable to look at
- Look into the issue ticket to figure out what parts to rework
- Could we get rid of Nydus, or at least turn it into a EventTarget event bus? Is it possible? It should, right?
    - Is there even need for the messaging protocol anymore since v3?
        - Okay we need to still keep messages but let's rework the messaging 
- Change sole jsdoc files into Typescript  or d.ts files and make the types actual typescript interfaces
